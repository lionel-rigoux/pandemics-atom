# Pandemics plugin

Atom plugin for using [Pandemics](https://pandemics.gitlab.io) directly in Atom.

Note that so far this plugin can only manage publishing operations.
To install new recipes, you'll have to use the Pandemic CLI or copy them directly in `~/.pandemics`.

## Requirements

You will need Latex installed on your computer (see Pandemics documentation).

## Usage

- Open your markdown document
- `ctrl+cmd+p` to publish with Pandemics
