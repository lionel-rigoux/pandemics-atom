# Pandemic plugin

Atom plugin for using [Pandemic](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pandemic) directly in Atom.

Note that so far this plugin can only manage publishing operations.
To install new recipes, you'll have to use the Pandemic CLI or copy them directly in `~/.pandemic`.

## Requirements

You will need Pandoc (>2.1.1) and some associated filters, and Latex installed on your computer (see Pandemic documentation).

## Usage

- Open your markdown document
- `ctrl+cmd+p` to publish with Pandemic
